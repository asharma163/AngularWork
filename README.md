index.html is served by the browser.

<app-root> component is replaced by its content (html).

How is angular triggred to load content of the custome selector i.e. in this case <app-root>?

In the final index.html file, whenever project rebuilt js object bundles added by automation.
All components except root component are in the app.component.html file.

Use ng g c "component name" to create component from cli.

custom selectors can be used as css selectors also.
